# Welcome to My GitHub!

👋 Hi, I'm **Zaoqu Liu**  
**MD candidate** and **PhD student** at [Peking Union Medical College](http://www.cams.ac.cn/)

## 🔬 Research Focus
My research primarily explores the role of **cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)** in cancer progression, metastasis, and drug resistance.  
I employ advanced techniques like:
- **Single-cell RNA sequencing**
- **Spatial transcriptomics**
- **In vitro & In vivo models**  

These help me understand the tumor microenvironment's complex interactions and its impact on cancer development and therapy response.

## 🛠️ Tools & Projects

In addition to my research, I develop several tools to solve challenges in data analysis, optimization, and survival modeling, particularly in the biomedical field:

- [**IRLS**](https://github.com/Zaoqu-Liu/IRLS) – Iterative Reweighted Least Squares for statistical tasks.
- [**BioEnricher**](https://github.com/Zaoqu-Liu/BioEnricher) – A bioinformatics tool for enriching genomic data.
- [**MOFS**](https://github.com/Zaoqu-Liu/MOFS) – Multi-objective optimization framework.
- [**TimeCCI**](https://github.com/Zaoqu-Liu/TimeCCI) – Time series data modeling and forecasting.
- [**SurvivalML**](https://github.com/Zaoqu-Liu/SurvivalML) – Survival analysis using machine learning techniques.
