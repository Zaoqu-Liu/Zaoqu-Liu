My research focuses on cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and their role in cancer progression, metastasis, and drug resistance. I use advanced techniques such as single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and both in vitro and in vivo models to investigate how the tumor microenvironment influences cancer development and therapy response.

In addition to my research, I develop several tools, including IRLS, BioEnricher, MOFS, TimeCCI, and SurvivalML. These tools are designed to address challenges in data analysis, optimization, and survival modeling, with a particular focus on applications in the biomedical field.
