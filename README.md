I am a PhD at Peking Union Medical College, specializing in the role of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in cancer progression, metastasis, and drug resistance. My research integrates single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and both in vitro and in vivo models to explore the complex interactions and mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment.
